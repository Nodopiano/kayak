# Kayak
Kayak is a wrapper around docker-compose, based on Vessel. By default, the following containers are started: Apache/php7.0, MariaDB, PhpMyAdmin. The /wp_html directory is the web root which is mapped to the apache/php container.
A Dockerfile is included for apache2/wordpress (Dockerfile). This adds a few extra things to the wordpress image, such as wp-cli.
You can start the containers with:
```
kayak start
```
